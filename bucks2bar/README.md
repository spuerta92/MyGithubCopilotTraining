# Bucks2Bar

This is a simple HTML project that uses the latest version of Bootstrap.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `css/style.css`: Custom CSS file for additional styles.
- `js/script.js`: Custom JavaScript file for additional scripts.
- `lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css`: Minified Bootstrap CSS file.
- `lib/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js`: Minified Bootstrap JS file.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project.

## Usage

You can edit the HTML, CSS, and JS files as needed for your project. The Bootstrap files are included for you to use the Bootstrap framework.

Remember to include the Bootstrap CSS file in the head of your HTML file and the Bootstrap JS file before the closing body tag. Also, include your custom CSS file after the Bootstrap CSS file and your custom JS file after the Bootstrap JS file.

This will ensure that your custom styles and scripts override the Bootstrap defaults as needed.
